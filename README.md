# Password_Vault
Description:
Password Vault is a Java-based application demonstrating object-oriented programming principles, focusing on encapsulation and array of objects. It allows users to securely store and retrieve credentials (website, username, password) using a master key, ensuring sensitive data is protected. The vault dynamically expands to accommodate unlimited credentials, making it practical and scalable.

Features:

Add and store multiple credentials securely

Retrieve passwords with a master key

Dynamic array resizing for unlimited entries

Fully encapsulated data — passwords are never exposed directly

Simple menu-driven console interface

Technologies:

Java (OOP, Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Arrays)

Console-based interaction (Scanner)

Learning Outcomes:

Understand encapsulation and data hiding in Java

Work with array of objects for dynamic storage

Implement a basic secure password management system

How to Run:

Clone the repository

Compile all .java files
